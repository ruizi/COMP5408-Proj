# COMP5408-Project

This is the repository for COMP5408 Ads final project.

In this project, I implemented three solutions to find out the element which is equal or larger than the targer in different array lists.

- 1. Apply Binary search in every sorted list and output the results

- 2. Merging all sorted list into one and apply binary search

- 3. Using Fractional Cascading

## How to run it in your local env?

#### 1. Download it from Github

#### 3. Install the run time env

This project is writen with TypeScript and running on Node.js environment.
So, if you want to run it in you local machine.

1. Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/

2. Open termainl in the project folder & Run the following commend:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run alogrithems

   - You can change the searching target in `index.js` file in root dir of this project,

   - We have experiment mode which will read three arrays which were pre-defined or use batch mode which will generate a batch of data and run all the three solutions several times.

   Do some modification in `index.ts` if you like and run the following commend in you terminal:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Result

- 1. For experiment mode:
